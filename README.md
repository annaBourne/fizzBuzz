# FizzBuzz

A typical programming interview question...The first iteration of this FizzBuzz program comes from the KISS school of thought.  
No fancy schmancy stuff...just get the job done.  This is also a first foray into writing in C#.  Why not start with a classic problem
and build it from there. I wrote this in Visual Studio, via a Parallels Windows 10 VM, on a MacBook Pro.

The Name of the Game
--------------------

The idea of FizzBuzz is:
- Take the numbers from 1 to 100
- For every number divisible by 3 and 5, the system prints out "FizzBuzz",
- For every number divisible by 3, the system prints out "Fizz", 
- For every number divisible by 5, the system prints out "Buzz".
